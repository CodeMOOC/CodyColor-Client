    "RULES": "<p>CodyColor MultiPlayer is the online implementation of the <a href=\"http://codemooc.org/codycolor/\"> CodyColor unplugged coding method</a>. It allows connected users to challenge each other in pairs, letting the game itself randomly select its opponent, or creating custom games to which you can invite your friends. </p> <p> Once you have accessed the game, the user is faced with a colored chess board and a robot (Roby). Each player must place his robot, dragging it in one of the starting positions (indicated by the arrows at the edges of the board) within the time limit. When players have positioned their robots, they will begin to move inside the board, taking a different direction depending on the color of the tiles: </p> <p> At the yellow tiles, Roby will turn 90 degrees to the left. </p> <p> Next to the and red tiles, 90 degrees to the right. </p> <p> In correspondence with the gray tiles, it will continue straight. </p> <p> The aim of the game is to choose a starting position such that the robot remains inside the chessboard as long as possible. Wins the player who scores the most points at the end of the game; points that can be earned by traveling as long as possible inside the chess board, or by positioning your robot more quickly than the opponent. In the event of an absolute draw, the player who first placed his Roby wins. </p> <p> Once the game is over, players can decide to do more matches in a sequence. </p> ",
